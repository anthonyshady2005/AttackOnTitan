# AttackOnTitan
A one-player, endless, tower defense game inspired by the hit anime Attack on Titan.

The battlefield is divided into multiple lanes, each lane will have the
following:
1. A part of the wall to be defended. This wall part will have a starting
HP (health points) that decreases after being attacked and if this part
of the wall is destroyed, this lane will no longer be considered an
active lane and will be a lost lane.
2. The weapons that the player has already deployed into this lane.
3. The titans that are on their way to attack the part of the wall at the
end of the lane. The titans can be at different distances from the
walls depending on how much they have already moved. Each titan
will have a starting HP (health points) that decreases after being
attacked.
Each lane will have a danger level that can be calculated based on the
number and types of titans inside this lane.
In the player’s base, the player will have the option to see all the available
types of weapons and can choose to buy and deploy them into their
choice of an active lane. The player should be able to view the currently
gathered resources and acquired score as well as the remaining HPs of
all walls and titans as well as each titan’s distance from the wall. The
player can also see the approaching titans in order, these approaching
titans will be added to the lanes in the upcoming turns.
